## FamilyChoreManager

### lite-server is running the project with npm-start in another tab i run tsc -w from the global TSC

### In the src directory is the app.ts file I have some Base Classes That Other Classes Extend From

#### Base Class Chore

#### Base Class State

#### Chore State Extends State

#### Validation Interface And Logic

#### Abstract Class Component Uses Generics To Extend The Elements

#### ChoreItem Class Extends Component

#### ChoreList Class Extends Component

#### ChoreInput Class Extends Component

#### TSC compiles The TS to JS and puts it in the dist directory with sourceMap set to true

#### MinLength and MaxLength Is A Thing As Far As Validation I Don't Guess It Is Necessary 

#### Add A Chore By Picking A Child From The DropDown and Filling Out The From

#### When The Chore Is Complete Drag and Drop Into The Finished Chores Box and The Styling will Take Effect
